I want to create a trip planner application that helps to create the best possible trip during the allotted (chosen time slots) in terms of showcasing weather, what to wear, what to do, all of that; it hooks up to OpenAI backend and is a very nice seamless, minimalistic modern ui/ux where users can input there departure and arrival and have all of the updates not only on their flights, but signicant weather events, news, things to do, etc and even more for the duration of their trip.
